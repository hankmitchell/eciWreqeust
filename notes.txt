Use this interface to create new repositories or clone existing remote repositories. To add an existing repository to the list of cPanel-managed repositories, select that repository path when you create the repository. The system will automatically add and configure the repository. In order to clone private repositories, advanced users should preconfigure access. For more information, read our documentation.
